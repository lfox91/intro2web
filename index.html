              <h3> What Makes Me Tick </h3>
              <p> My top priorities in life are to create
              and learn. This must be what draws me to
              coding so strongly. With software, there
              are few restrictions on what you can
                 create. The idea that one person can
                 create a complete product and put into
                 the world with only a computer astounds
                 and inspires me to strive to make my own
                 mark on the world through software. In
                 terms of learning, you can never know
                 all there is to know about software
                 engineering. There will always be a new
                 language, a new technology, or a new
                 design pattern. The innate vagaries that
                 are found in and around the technical
                 community compel me to pick up skills as
                 quickly and efficiently as I can muster.
                 </p>
              <h3> What Do I Do </h3>
              <p> I most recently worked on an offline
              documentation repository called <a
              href="www.docwave,io">docwave</a>. I mainly
            worked on the back end specifically utilizing
            a node/express server and a NoSQL database.
            We scraped a slew of sites for documentation,
            parsed them into a manageable JSON file, and
            then we shipped that off to our electron app
            (through the use of basic AJAX calls on the
            client-side . Feel free to download this
            project. Though docwave is still in beta, it
            is available for both Linux and Mac OS. </p>
              <h3> What I'd Like To Do </h3>
              <p> I am looking for a company where I can
              learn. I'd like to work on a small (to
              medium) sized team that thrives in an agile
              environment. I enjoy working on the server
              and implementing designs. I also enjoy
              creating; I would not be opposed to doing
              light design work. I am most knowledgeable
              about javascript but I am open to new
              languages specifically, Ruby, Go, RUST,
              java, and erlang. I am interested in being
              part of a fast-paced environment that
              frequently tackles new projects. If you'd
              like to see some of my past projects, feel
              free to visit my <a
              href="www.github.com/lfox91">github
